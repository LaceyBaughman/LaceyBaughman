------------------------- Swat Analysis -------------------------

Strengths: Easily exercising theory of the mind, although narrow in scope (I've self-observed that I use it most freely on individuals and individual experiences), making me a non-judgemental and arrested listener. I thrive within and while using systems and procedures and enjoy clearly defined boundaries. My communication style is to be purpetually sincere and direct. When I believe in a project or goal, or when I'm excited by a project or goal, I get access to an inner well of persistent energy and focus. I assume the best of/from people and only allow that outlook/perspective to change with contrary evidence. 

Weaknesses: Difficulty breaking down large projects into step by step actionable tasks without talking it out with someone or physially sketching it out (pen and paper). Inability to intuitively (without intent and forsight) identify subtext; which is why I prefer and use a direct communication style. I have weak expressive language skills: it's hard for me to vocalize "big" ideas and feelings without using metaphor or examples.

Opportunities: I am currently working my receptive (in reference to subtext) and expressive  language skills by; mindfully working at expressing more concretely and difinitively, and asking for more peer input, and I see this as continuously growing opportunity to collaborate and both understand and be understood. I think that if/when my communication style is appreciated I can help foster healthy growing environments and have self-observed that I grow best in these environments too. 

Threats: When the saftey and support of a healthy system/culture isn't in place, my weaknesses bloom. I will silo myself if I don't feel safe, which means I'm less likely to express struggles or a need for help - and that's why people (how they communicate), culture (what the community values), and environment (what's inentionally being fostered) are extremely important to me.
