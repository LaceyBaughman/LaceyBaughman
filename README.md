Hello, world! My name is Lacey Baughman and I have a wide range of skills and work experience. I have a background in lean manufacturing, mechanical design (ProCad, AutoCad, Solidworks), accounting, federal tax reporting, professional horseback riding, and Iâ€™ve dabbled in stage acting. At home Iâ€™m the mother of two beautiful girls and the wife of a US Navy veteran and Cyber Security Engineer. I have lived in Boise, Idaho and Seattle, Washington for most of my life but have traveled to 25 of the 50 United States, Mexico, Canada, and Denmark. Basically, Iâ€™ve seen some things and talked to a great many people and I fully intend to do and see more! 

  Iâ€™m currently working on: Drone pilotâ€™s license, AWS Cloud cert, and leveling up my photography skills.
  
  Iâ€™m currently planning to: take my family to see Europe in Summer 2023.
  
âš¡ Fun facts about me: I love gardening, all things horses, farming, RPG games, sandbox survival games, my favorite DND class to play is druid, and my favorite genres to read are fantasy, scifi, psychology, and socio-cultural journalism.
