Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm âœ¨ Lacey âœ¨ - everybodyâ€™s all-time absolute favorite student/peer at Boise Codeworks (no need to fact check me ðŸ˜„), 
and Iâ€™m learning about full-stack software development. Iâ€™ve become a jack of all trades in my search for the shoe that fits. 
I have a background in lean manufacturing, mechanical design (ProCad, Solidworks), bookkeeping (heavy on personal businesses and non-profits) using Quickbooks and Peoplesoft and federal tax reporting (personal, llc's, estate, 1099, small-business), and Iâ€™ve dabbled in stage acting. Basically, Iâ€™ve seen some things and 
talked to some people. I love software development because it satisfies my desire to build and maintain while also giving me 
endless opportunities to be creative. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: completing my certification in Full-Stack software Development from Boise Codeworks by the end of April. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: the MVC pattern and working with API's. 

âš¡ Fun facts about me: I love gardening, all things horses, farming, RPG games, sandbox survival games, my favorite DND class to play is druid, and my favorite genres to read are fantasy, scifi, psychology, and socio-cultural journalism. 

ðŸ“«  Feel free to reach out to me!
